// Introduction to Node.js
// 1. Write a simple Node.js script that logs "Hello, Node.js!" to the console.
// 2. Create a Node.js module that exports a function. Import and use this function in another file.
// 3. Use Node.js to read the contents of a file and log it to the console.

// Working with the File System (fs module)
// 4. Write a script that creates a new file and writes some text to it using the fs module.
// 5. Use the fs module to append text to an existing file.
// 6. Write a script that reads the contents of a directory and logs the names of all files and directories within it.

// Working with HTTP Module
// 7. Create a basic HTTP server that responds with "Hello, World!" when accessed in the browser.
// 8. Modify your server to serve different content based on the URL path (e.g., "/about", "/contact").
// 9. Set up a simple API endpoint that returns JSON data when accessed.

// Handling Asynchronous Code
// 10. Write a function that simulates a time-consuming task using setTimeout and logs a message when itâ€™s done.
// 11. Convert a callback-based function to use Promises.
// 12. Use async/await to handle an asynchronous operation, such as reading a file.

// Working with Express.js
// 13. Set up an Express server and create a route that responds with "Welcome to Express!".
// 14. Create a RESTful API with Express that supports CRUD operations for a simple resource (e.g., tasks, users).
// 15. Use middleware in Express to log request details to the console each time a request is made.

// Working with Databases
// 16. Connect to a MongoDB database using Mongoose and create a simple schema/model.
// 17. Write a script that inserts a new document into a MongoDB collection.
// 18. Retrieve and display all documents from a MongoDB collection using Mongoose.

// Authentication and Authorization
// 19. Implement user registration and login functionality using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication.
// 20. Protect certain routes in your Express app so that only authenticated users can access them.
// 21. Create middleware to check if a user is an admin and restrict access to certain routes accordingly.

// Working with APIs
// 22. Make an HTTP request to an external API using the Axios or Node-fetch package and log the response data.
// 23. Set up an Express route that fetches data from an external API and returns it as JSON.
// 24. Implement error handling for API requests, ensuring the server responds gracefully to failed requests.

// Working with Websockets
// 25. Set up a WebSocket server using the 'ws' package and create a simple chat application.
// 26. Broadcast messages to all connected clients when a new message is received on the WebSocket server.
// 27. Implement a feature where users are notified when someone joins or leaves the chat.


// Error Handling and Debugging
// 28. Write a try/catch block to handle potential errors when reading a file that might not exist.
// 29. Create custom error classes in Node.js and throw them in different scenarios to test error handling.
// 30. Use the 'debug' package to add debug statements throughout your application for easier troubleshooting.

// Working with Streams
// 31. Create a readable stream from a file and log the data chunks as they are read.
// 32. Use a writable stream to write data to a file in chunks.
// 33. Implement a Transform stream that modifies data as it passes through, such as converting text to uppercase.

// Working with Buffers
// 34. Create a buffer from a string and log its contents in hexadecimal format.
// 35. Write a script that copies data from one buffer to another using Buffer methods.
// 36. Use buffers to read and manipulate binary data from a file.

// Deployment and Production
// 37. Prepare your Node.js application for deployment by setting up environment variables for configuration.
// 38. Write a script to serve your static files in production using Express.
// 39. Implement a logging system that logs errors and important events to a file.

// Testing in Node.js
// 40. Set up a simple test using the 'mocha' and 'chai' testing libraries to test a basic function in your Node.js application.
// 41. Write a test to verify that your Express routes return the expected responses.
// 42. Implement a test for an asynchronous function to ensure it handles errors correctly.
