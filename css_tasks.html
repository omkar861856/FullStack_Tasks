  <!-- HTML -->
  <!-- 1. Create a simple paragraph and use CSS to style the text color, font size, and background color of a paragraph. -->
  <!-- 2. Add CSS to an HTML file to make all headings (h1, h2, etc.) bold and blue. -->
  <!-- 3. Write CSS to center-align a div element horizontally and vertically within the viewport. -->
  <!-- 4. Use an external CSS file to change the appearance of multiple HTML files simultaneously. -->
  <!-- 5. Demonstrate how CSS inheritance works by applying a color to a parent element and showing how it affects child elements. -->
  <!-- Property vs Value -->
  <!-- 6. Set the background color of a div to 'lightblue' and explain the role of 'background-color' as a CSS property and 'lightblue' as its value. -->
  <!-- 7. Apply different font sizes to paragraphs and explain how CSS properties can have different values. -->
  <!-- 8. Write CSS to apply multiple values to the 'font-family' property to provide fallbacks in case a font is not available. -->

  <!-- Selector - tag vs class vs id -->
  <!-- 9. Create an HTML file with several paragraphs and use a tag selector to style all paragraphs with the same color. -->
  <!-- 10. Write CSS to style a specific paragraph using a class selector. -->
  <!-- 11. Use an ID selector to style a single div element with a unique background color. -->
  <!-- 12. Combine class and ID selectors to style an element that has both. -->

  <!-- Intro to Pseudo-elements and Pseudo-classes -->

  <!-- 15. Demonstrate the use of the '::before' pseudo-element to insert content before a heading. -->
  <!-- 16. Write CSS to style every even-numbered row in a table differently using ':nth-child(even)'. -->

  <!-- Parent Inherit -->
  <!-- 17. Apply a font color to a parent div and observe how child elements inherit this property. -->
  <!-- 18. Override an inherited style in a child element using a more specific selector. -->

  <!-- Box Model - Margin, Padding, Border -->
  <!-- 19. Create a box with a 20px padding, a 10px margin, and a 2px solid border. -->
  <!-- 20. Adjust the box model properties to make sure the box size remains the same when padding is increased. -->
  <!-- 21. Demonstrate the difference between padding and margin by applying different values to a div. -->

  <!-- Flex - Display, Direction, Wrap, Flex-flow, Justify-content, Align-content -->
  <!-- 22. Set up a flex container with three items and make them display in a row. -->
  <!-- 23. Use 'flex-direction' to stack the items vertically instead of horizontally. -->
  <!-- 24. Apply 'flex-wrap' to allow items to wrap to the next line when the container is too small. -->
  <!-- 25. Combine 'flex-direction' and 'flex-wrap' using the 'flex-flow' shorthand property. -->
  <!-- 26. Use 'justify-content' to space out items in a flex container with equal space between them. -->
  <!-- 27. Align items in a flex container to the center of the cross axis using 'align-content'. -->

  <!-- Position Property - Static, Relative, Absolute, Fixed, Sticky -->
  <!-- 28. Create a div with 'static' positioning and observe how it behaves in the document flow. -->
  <!-- 29. Change the div's position to 'relative' and move it 20px to the right using 'left'. -->
  <!-- 30. Use 'absolute' positioning to place a div at the bottom-right corner of its containing element. -->

  <!-- 32. Fix a sidebar to the left of the viewport so that it stays in place when scrolling. -->

  <!-- Overflow Property - Hidden, Visible, Scroll, Auto -->
  <!-- 33. Create a div with content that overflows its bounds and use 'overflow: hidden' to hide the excess content. -->
  <!-- 34. Change the 'overflow' property to 'scroll' to allow scrolling inside the div. -->
  <!-- 35. Use 'overflow: auto' to let the browser decide whether to show scrollbars based on content size. -->

  <!-- Box-shadow Property -->
  <!-- 36. Apply a box-shadow to a div to create a shadow effect around it. -->
  <!-- 37. Experiment with different box-shadow values to create a deep shadow and a subtle shadow. -->

  <!-- Media Query -->
  <!-- 38. Use media queries to change the background color of the body depending on the screen width. -->
  <!-- 39. Write a media query to make the font size of a paragraph larger on screens wider than 600px. -->
